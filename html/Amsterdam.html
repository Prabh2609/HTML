        <p> 
            Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands. With more than one million inhabitants in its urban area (and almost two and a half
            million inhabitants in its metropolitan area), it is the country's largest city and its financial, cultural, and creative centre.
            Amsterdam derives its name from the city’s origin as “Dam” of river “Amstel”. In the past, the name was "Amstelredamme" which later
            changed as “Amsterdam”. Amsterdam is one of the most popular destinations in Europe, attracting over 7 million international travellers
            annually.<br/>
            Amsterdam is colloquially known as Venice of the North because of its lovely canals that criss-cross the city, its impressive architecture
            and more than 1,500 bridges. There is something for every traveller's taste here; whether you prefer culture and history, serious partying,
            or just the relaxing charm of an old European city.
        </p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
       <p>
            Amsterdam is a large city and a major tourist destination, so you can visit it all year round. However, in winter
            the days are short (8 hours daylight around Christmas), and the weather may be too cold to walk around the city comfortably,
            let alone cycle. January and February are the coldest months, with lows around -1°C and highs around 5°C. July and August are
            the warmest months, with an average temperature of 22°C (72°F). Some things are seasonal: the tulip fields flower only in the spring
