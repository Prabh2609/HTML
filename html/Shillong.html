        <h3 style="text-align:center">Shillong</h3>
        <p>
            Shillong was the capital of Assam, but after the state was split into Assam and Meghalya (meaning 'the abode of the clouds'),
            it became the first capital of the newly formed State of Meghalaya. Located in undulating pine covered hills, the city has a
            milder climate than tropical India. The city centre is 1496m above sea level and currently has a population of around 270,000.
            Home to several waterfalls, it is also known as the Scotland of the East. The British legacy is still visible in the architecture
            and food habits of the population. The Assam style houses with slanting roofs, large number of windows and wooden floors look like
            a piece of art (and happen to be a very good idea, considering Shillong lies in an area where rains and earthquakes are very common).

        <h3>Best Time To visit</h3>
       <p>
            Shillong has pleasant climate through the year and can be visited at any time. Here’s a seasonal break-up through the months so you
            can plan your trip better:<br/> 
            <strong>March to June</strong>: March and April see the advent of summers but the weather is still quite pleasant. Summers are overall mild and a good
            time to plan a trip in Shillong with the temperature ranging from a maximum of 24°C to a minimum of 15°C. This is the perfect time to
            plan sightseeing and adventure activities.<br/> 
            <strong>June to September</strong>: Monsoon months see average to heavy rainfalls in Shillong. This is a great time to visit the waterfalls and enjoy
            the gorgeous rain washed vistas of the region. July is the wettest month in Shillong. It’s not a popular tourist time given that many
            tourists do not prefer to travel during monsoons, but that makes it a good time to find reasonable hotels.
